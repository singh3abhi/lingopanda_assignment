# Internship Assignment For LingoPanda (E-Shop)

I created the required Internship Assignment with Flutter as a front-end client and MVVM pattern for application design because it helps in separating the data, logic, and the UI part. I have also implemented Provider for the app's State Management which is an effective way of managing the state.

Improvements which could have been added
1) Splash Screen
2) Internet connectivity check feature
3) Shimmer product cards in home
